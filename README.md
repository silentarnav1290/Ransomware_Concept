## Ransomware_Concept
Python Based Simple POC ransomware <br />
This program is a simple proof of concept ransomware that I built in order to learn how ransomwares work.<br />
This is a simple concept and demo application for how ransomware works.<br />
This application is NOT intended to be used for malicious purposes.<br />
This program encrypts a file and creates a decryption key file which contains decryption key to your encrypted file so be careful while deleting that file.<br />
I am not responsible for any loss of data or permanent encryption of files in case of deletion of decryption key by the user.<br />
## And don't worry as the program is not your typical ransomware so it won't act like one, it will ask you the file to encrypt and decrypt through user input.

To run this program in Windows make sure python-3.X is installed.<br />
Download the repository by the following command:<br />
git clone https://github.com/silentarnav1290/Ransomware_Concept.git<br />
Then open the EXE Build folder and just double click on Ransomware_Concept exe file.<br />

To run the program in Linux based OS make sure python-3.X is installed.(Although python is preinstalled in linux based OS)<br />
Download the repository by the following command:<br />
git clone https://github.com/silentarnav1290/Ransomware_Concept.git<br />
Then give execution permission to RansomwareC_setup.sh by the following command in terminal inside the file directory:<br />
chmod +x RansomwareC_setup.sh<br />
Then simply run the program by executing in terminal.<br />
(Command to run: ./RansomwareC_setup.sh)<br />
